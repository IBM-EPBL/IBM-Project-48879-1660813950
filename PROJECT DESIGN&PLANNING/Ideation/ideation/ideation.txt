        SMART WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR METROPOLITAN CITIES

                    ABSTRACT

        With the increasing population and industrialization of nations throughout the globe, waste has become a great concern for all of us.
Over years, researchers figured that only waste management is not enough for its proper treatment and disposal techniques to preserve our
environment and keeping it clean in this era of globalization. With the help of technology researchers have, introduced IoT based 
Smart Waste Management solutions and initiatives that ensures reduced amount of time and energy required to provide waste management services and 
reduce the amount of waste generated. Unfortunately, developing countries are not being able to implement those existing solutions due to many factors like 
socio-economic environment. Therefore, in this research we have concentrated our thought on developing a smart IoT based waste management system for 
developing countries like INDIA that will ensure proper disposal, collection, transportation and recycling of household waste with the minimum amount of 
resources being available.
